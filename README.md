**scratchblocks** is used to write Scratch scripts:

- in [Scratch Forum](http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/14772/) posts
- in [Scratch Wiki](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Block_Plugin) articles 
- in the [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk) project guides

It's MIT licensed, so you can use it in your projects. (But do send me a link
[on Twitter](http://twitter.com/blob8108)!)

For the full guide to the syntax, see [the wiki](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Block_Plugin/Syntax).

# Usage

## MediaWiki

Use [the MediaWiki plugin](https://github.com/tjvr/wiki-scratchblocks). (This is what the [Scratch Wiki](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Block_Plugin) uses.)

## WordPress

I found [a WordPress plugin](https://github.com/tkc49/scratchblocks-for-wp). It might work for you; I haven't tried it.

## Pandoc

Code Club use their own [lesson_format](https://github.com/CodeClub/lesson_format) tool to generate the PDF versions of their project guides. It uses the [pandoc_scratchblocks](https://github.com/CodeClub/pandoc_scratchblocks) plugin they wrote to make pictures of Scratch scripts.

This would probably be a good way to write a Scratch book.

## Markdown

Inline code in your markdown like this:
    ```blocks
    when flag clicked
    go to x:(-50) y:(0)
    ```

Then use [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) or similar, and hook into the `highlight` option:

```js
var md = require('markdown-it')({
  // Highlighter function. Should return escaped HTML,
  // or '' if the source string is not changed and should be escaped externaly.
  // If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.
  highlight: function (str, lang) {
    if (lang === 'blocks') {
      return scratchblocks.renderSVGString(str);  // returns SVG as a string
    }
    // other languages
    return '';
  }
});
```

## HTML

Include the scratchblocks JS file on your webpage:

```html
<script src="https://scratchblocks.github.io/js/scratchblocks-3.x-min.js"></script>
```

Then call `scratchblocks.renderMatching` after the page has loaded, which
will render matching page elements to shiny scratch blocks. Its sole argument
is the CSS-style selector for the elements that contain the scratchblocks code.
It uses `pre.blocks` by default.

```js
scratchblocks.renderMatching('pre.blocks');
```

### Inline blocks

To use blocks inside a paragraph...

```html
I'm rather fond of the <code class="b">stamp</code> block in Scratch.
```

...make a separate call to `renderMatching` using the `inline` argument.

```js
scratchblocks.renderMatching("code.b", {inline: true});
```

## Server-side (Node)

There's an experimental Node port thanks to @arve0.

Example usage:

```js
var scratchblocks = require('scratchblocks');
var doc = scratchblocks.parse(`
when flag clicked
`)
doc.render(svg => {
  var content = doc.exportSVGString()
  console.log(content);
})
```

```sh
$node test.js > foo.xml
```

## Browserify

You can even use `scratchblocks` with browserify, if you're into that sort of
thing.

Once you've got browserify set up to build a client-side bundle from your app
code, you can just add `scratchblocks` to your dependencies, and everything
should Just Workâ„¢.

```js
var scratchblocks = require('scratchblocks');
scratchblocks.renderMatching('pre.blocks');
```

# Languages

In node, all languages in [`src/locales`](https://github.com/tjvr/scratchblocks/blob/master/src/locales) will be loaded.

In the browser, include [`translations.js`](https://github.com/tjvr/scratchblocks/blob/master/browser/translations.js), [`all-translations.js`](https://github.com/tjvr/scratchblocks/blob/master/browser/translations.js) or build your own language pack.

`translations.js` contains all the languages needed [on the Scratch Forums](http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/#category_head_6).

`translations-all.js` contains all the languages Scratch supports.

If you want to build your own language pack, use `scratchblocks.loadLanguage(lang)` where lang is the contents of `src/locales/lang.json`.

Please note that scratchblocks **requires** some [additional words](https://github.com/tjvr/scratchblocks/blob/master/src/locales/extra_aliases.js) which aren't in Scratch itself (mainly the words used for the flag and arrow images). I'd be happy to accept pull requests for those!


# Development

This should set you up and start a http-server for development:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000/> :-)
